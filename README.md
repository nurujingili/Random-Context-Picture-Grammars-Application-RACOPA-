# Random-Context-Picture-Grammars-Application-RACOPA-
An application for reading random context picture grammars and generate pictures. RACOPA consists of two files namely randomcontext.py which contains the code and rcgrammar.py which comprises of the grammar rules. The application is initialised by executing the file randomcontext.py. Loading the randomcontext.py file creates a .png file of each transformation of the picture and saves it in the folder. Loading the randomcontext.py several times allows generation of different pictures by the same grammar. The rcgrammar.py file can be rewritten to change the grammar.
